# Project Refactoring with SOLID Principles
## Overview

This project is a refactoring of the original project implemented during the Rocketseat Next Level Week Unite event. The primary objective of this refactoring is to apply the principles of SOLID architecture to enhance code maintainability, scalability, and extensibility.

### About SOLID Principles
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Here's a brief overview of each principle:

S - Single Responsibility Principle: Each module or class should have only one reason to change.

O - Open/Closed Principle: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

L - Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

I - Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

D - Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, and abstractions should not depend on details.

Refactoring Approach
In this project, I have meticulously applied each of the SOLID principles to refactor the original codebase. The goal was to improve code readability, facilitate future modifications, and ensure the system's robustness.

### Key Changes
Single Responsibility Principle: Refactored classes and modules to have single responsibilities, making the codebase more modular and easier to understand.
Open/Closed Principle: Implemented design patterns such as Strategy Pattern and Dependency Injection to allow for easy extension without modifying existing code.
Liskov Substitution Principle: Ensured that derived classes could be substituted for their base classes without affecting the program's behavior.
Interface Segregation Principle: Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones, to prevent clients from depending on methods they don't use.
Dependency Inversion Principle: Decoupled high-level modules from low-level implementation details by introducing abstractions and employing dependency injection.

### Getting Started
To get started with this refactored project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository.
Install any necessary dependencies.
Explore the refactored codebase to understand the application's architecture and structure.
Run the application and test its functionality to ensure everything works as expected.
Feedback and Contributions
Feedback and contributions are highly appreciated. If you have any suggestions for further improving the codebase or implementing additional SOLID principles, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
